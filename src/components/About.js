            My name is Dowling Briggs and I was born and raised in Birmingham, AL. I attended the University of Alabama graduating in 2017 with an MIS degree with a minor in Computing App & Technologies. I was hired by Accenture in Nashville straight out of college
            where I worked as an Application Development Associate Consultant working specifically in the RPA sector doing development work. RPA is Robotic Process Automation and was essentially building software robots for clients to help them improve
             the efficiency and accuracy of their business processes.
